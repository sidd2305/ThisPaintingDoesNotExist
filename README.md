## How it Works

ThisPaintingDoesntExist utilizes a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) to generate lifelike portrait drawings. The GAN consists of a generator network that creates realistic portraits and a discriminator network that evaluates the authenticity of the generated images. Through a process of adversarial training, the generator refines its ability to produce convincing portraits, while the discriminator becomes adept at distinguishing between AI-generated and real images. This dynamic interplay results in the creation of striking, never-before-seen portraits that blend the finesse of technology with the beauty of art.
